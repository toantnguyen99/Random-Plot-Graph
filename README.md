# (Java) Random-Plot-Graph

## Description
This project draws randomly generated points in 3 similar styles graph continuously. The goal is to practice different **software design patterns**. Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. The patterns used in this project are **observer pattern** (to notify when to redraw graphs) and **decorator pattern** (to reuse similar components when drawing the 3 graphs). It uses java.swing library for the UI, ActionListener interface for the mouse click, and TimerTask Runnable for creating random values for points in the background. The structure of the project can be found in *UMLDiagram.JPG*.
